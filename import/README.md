* *BR* (Biennial Reporting): Information collected in odd numbered years regarding the generation, management, and final disposition of hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA. 
* *RMP* (Risk Management Plan): RMP requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan. These plans must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years.
* *FRS* (Facility Registry Service): Database that identifies facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. This allows matching of facilities across ICIS-Air, TRI, GHG (E-GGRT), RCRAInfo, SDWIS, ICIS-NPDES, and ICIS-FE&C.
