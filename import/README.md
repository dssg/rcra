This directory contains scripts and Drakefiles to obtain and process the data used in the model. Data sources that require a specialized process have their own subdirectories and Drakefiles. 


* *BR* (Biennial Reporting): Information collected in odd numbered years regarding the generation, management, and final disposition of hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA. 
* *RMP* (Risk Management Plan): RMP requires facilities that use extremely hazardous substances to develop a Risk Management Plan. These plans must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years.
* *FRS* (Facility Registry Service): Database that identifies facilities, sites or places subject to environmental regulations or of environmental interest. Using the FRS program interest linkage, records included in the FRS download file are those with a valid FRS ID and which are cross-referenced by ID number to data contained in ICIS-Air, TRI, GHG (E-GGRT), RCRAInfo, SDWIS, or ICIS-NPDES, or which are linked to a formal enforcement action in ICIS-FE&C.
